These are the resource files needed for the [Simple Store Locator with Google Maps](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/google-maps-simple-store-locator/)
code lab from Google.

## Introduction for the [Simple Store Locator with Google Maps](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/google-maps-simple-store-locator/)

One of the most common features of a website is displaying a [Google Map](https://developers.google.com/maps/) that highlights one or more locations for a business, institution, or any kind of entity with a physical presence. How these are implemented can vary greatly depending on requirements, such as the number of locations, and the frequency with which they change.

In this codelab, we’ll look at the simplest use-case - a small number of locations that rarely change, like a store locator for a business with a chain of stores. In this case, we can use a relatively low-tech approach, without any server-side programming. But that’s not to say we can’t be creative, and we’ll do so by leveraging the [GeoJSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON) data format to store and render arbitrary information about each store on our map, as well as customizing the markers and overall style of the map itself.

Lastly, as an added bonus we’ll use tools like [Google Cloud Shell](https://cloud.google.com/shell/) and [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/) to develop and host our store locator. While using these tools isn’t strictly required, doing so allows us to develop the store locator from any device running a web browser, and make it available online to the public.
